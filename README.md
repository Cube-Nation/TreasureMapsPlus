# TreasureMapsPlus

This plugin provides a solution to the lag spikes that are caused by treasure maps searching for a location to put on a map. This plugin just makes those maps provide the loot table when you right click with the map in your hand.

Supports maps found in loot tables and villager trades.

## Build
`./gradlew build`

## Test
### On re-obfuscated server
`./gradlew runServer`
### On mojang-mapped server
If a version has not been released but a dev-bundle has, you can
run a mojang-mapped server with
`./gradlew runMojangMappedServer`
